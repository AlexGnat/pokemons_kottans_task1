## Technologies/libraries

  1 I used Bootstrap to make the page mobile-friendly and responsive on different screen sizes
  2 I used AngularJS (1.5.3) to link model and view, because Angular is good for showing data and filtering them (and it was a good chance to study Angular)

## Features
  1 "Load more" button loads more Pokemon cards
  2 There is a filter on top right side that allows to filter Pokemons by type (normal/fire/etc.)
  3 The filter shows the types of Pokemons that are already loaded
  4 If a filter is applied, "Load more" button still loads 12 more Pokemons but shows only the cards that match the filter
